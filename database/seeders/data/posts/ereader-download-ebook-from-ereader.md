This article was written using a **Kobo (Clara HD)** to present the use of a web browser with an eReader. Therefore the screenshots presented to show how to use the browser are related to the Kobo interface. Most eReaders offer a browser but its location may differ from one eReader to another, so please refer to specialized articles on your eReader if the present guide is not enough to find it. **If your eReader don't offer any browser, you can't use this guide.**

With your eReader you can download an eBook directly from Internet. To do this, you need to use your eReader's web browser to find a website that will offer you a direct download of an .epub file. The goal is to perform almost the same action as when you download a recently purchased eBook from your eReader's internal store, if your eReader offers one.

## Find your Internet browser

From the Kobo browser example, from the eReader's home screen, tap on "More" in bottom navigation and then choose "Beta Features"...

...and tap on "**Start**" in "**Web Browser**".

![Browser is hidden in submenu](IMAGE/ereader-download-ebook-from-ereader/kobo-beta-features.webp)

This will open the home page, usually on Google, you have **URL bar at the top**, **back, next & refresh buttons at the bottom** with a zoom bar, don't leave out the three dots indicating additional options at the bottom right as **you can add websites as favorites**.

Search any book with title, author firstname and lastname or series' title. If you have an author or a series in results, you can tap on it to get all books associate with it, you can't download directly all books, you have to tap on book you want and tap on "Download". Here, we've choose a book:

A popup will appear when you tap on "Download", if you continue, your browser will download eBook.

When you have eBook downloaded, you will find it in your books. If the book is associat√© with series, you can't display it with this method because .epub files have some limitations about series, to add series informations you will need a computer with Calibre, check [**Set series guide**](/guides/ereader-series) for more informations.
